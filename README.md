### Usage
****
__Include the css file.__

~~~
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/css/style.css"/>
~~~

__Include the js file.__

~~~
	<script src="dist/main.js"></script>
~~~

__Create a div with any class of your choice. This will be your message holder Egs;__

~~~
	<div class="your-class"></div>
~~~

__You can select your div class or pass in the class name directly as a string into the Msg class like so:__

~~~
	const holder = document.querySelector('.your-class');
	const msg = new Msg(holder);
~~~
or
~~~
	const msg = new Msg('.your-class');
~~~
__After passing in your message holder to the class as an argument, you will need to call the function ```init();```.  This init function takes in a config parameter which is an object. If you pass in an empty object, it means you want the default message configurations.__

**This config object takes some certain properties like so.**

~~~
	msg.init({
		msg: 'Hey this is a success message!!',
		type: 'success',
		mode: 'light',
		duration: 3000
	});
~~~
**The following properties and their neccesities are explained below.**

**```type```**: This is the most important property of all. It specifies if it is an error message or a success message. If this property is not found when trying to use your configurations. An error will be returned.

**```msg```**: This property specifies the message being displayed. i.e. the text to be shown.

**```mode```**: This property specifies the mode as shown in the example above! If you use a dark mode theme, message-alerts got your back. The default mode is the light mode by the way. This property is not important unless you want to specify a dark theme otherwise there's no need to pass in this property.

**```duration```**: This property specifies how long you want the message to show for as explicity shown by the name of the property! Just needed to say that. The default duration is 5000 miliseconds essentially 5 seconds

**```autoClose```**: This property specifies if you want the message box to auto close or if `false` then there will be a close button on the message box. 

**```btn```**: If you have `autoClose: false` then you can set `btn` as a property which is an object. It takes in properties like so

~~~~
	btn: {
		styles: ['padding: 2px', 'color: #fff'],
		content: 'Close Me'
	}
~~~~

Like you can see... you can set styles for the button to customize it to your taste. This `style` property takes in either an array of styles or a string which is a css class. So the above will set those styles directly for your button while. 

~~~~
	btn: {
		styles: 'btn',
		content: 'Close Me'
	}
~~~~

This will then set a class for the button. This helps to reduce code size and is way easier for code readability but the options are there. Choose whichever  

# Popups
__Popups are finally here__
****

To use a popup: Keep the config the same if you want to but change this.

~~~~
	msg.popup({
		msg: 'Hey this is a success message!!',
		type: 'error',
		duration: 4000
	});
~~~~

This is how to setup a popup, the must be properties are `msg` and `type`. These are compulsory properties. More functionalities to come to popups if needed!

__Future Updates__
****
This is not the final working version of ```message-alerts```. This is ```version 1.1.0```. It's the first stable version. There will be more versions. Do checkout for more.
